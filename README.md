# Smart-Fan-Control-System-Using-PIC16F877A
This project uses PIC16F877A to regulate fan speed based on an LM35 temperature sensor and an MQ-2 gas sensor. PWM controls the fan, while a relay and buzzer activate for high gas levels. A 16x2 LCD displays real-time data, ensuring energy efficiency, safety, and comfort in homes, labs, and industries.
